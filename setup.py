        SHPAML is a mini language that can help you to build web pages
        more quickly. It leverages familiar concepts from HTML and CSS,
        while striving to bring brevity and clarity to the primary
        documents that you edit. It plays nice with templating languages.

        SHPAML allows you to produce HTML with cleaner syntax, without
        introducing any other layer of abstraction. It does so in the
        following ways:

           1. Reduce punctuation
           2. Reduce the need for end tags
           3. Mimic CSS selector syntax
           4. Allow well-formed HTML to pass through
           5. Play nice with templating languages
